# Weather Data ETL Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing and analyzing weather data.

## Project Objectives

- Extracts weather data from two sources:
  - **Local CSV file**: `weather.csv`
  - **Remote API**: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs

- Transform data by:
  - Cleaning and preparing weather data
  - Converting temperature and other metrics into readable formats
  - Converting between file formats (JSON, CSV, SQL)

- Merging and analyzing the data 

- Load data into a SQLite database using Python’s `sqlite3` module

- Perform basic analysis and visualizations of trends in weather data

---

## Files Included in GitHub

- `weather.csv` : Original weather dataset 
- `FINAL_MIDTERM_PROJECT.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with the complete ETL pipeline

---

## Files Generated by Project Code 

- `2016_cleaned_data.csv` : Cleaned weather data from 2016 
- `2025_weather_data.csv` : Weather data from 2025 using the API in CSV format 
- `2025_weather_data.json` : Converted JSON version of 2025 dataset 
- `final_weather_comparison.csv` : Merged and cleaned final weather dataset 
- `final_weather_comparison.db` : SQLite database containing the final dataset 

---

## How to Run This Project

1. Make sure you have the required files:
   - `FINAL_MIDTERM_PROJECT.ipynb`
   - `weather.csv`: Will need to be downloaded and uploaded into notebook

2. Open the notebook and run each cell step by step.
